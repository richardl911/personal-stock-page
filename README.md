## Motivation
Who can remember what event happend an year ago that made <em> stock XXX </em> rise over 500%?  If you can not, you came to the right place!

Here, I am in the progress of development a front-end GUI, which allows you to remember what happened an year ago with <em> stock XXX </em> and beyond.

You are in control.  You can pick the stock charts you want and add whatever news you want to the chart!

## How to install
1. Download the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com/richardl911/personal-stock-page.git)
2. Navigate to the [web](./web/) directory
3. Click on [index.html](./web/index.html) to start the GUI
    * Designed/tested with Google Chrome
